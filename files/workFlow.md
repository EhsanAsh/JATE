# Acceptance Criteria

### GIVEN a text editor web application,

- *WHEN I* open my application in my editor,
- *THEN I* should see a client server folder structure.

- *WHEN I* run `npm run start` from the root directory,
- *THEN I* find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client.

- *WHEN I* run the text editor application from my terminal,
- *THEN I* find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack.

- *WHEN I* run my webpack plugins,
- *THEN I* find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.

- *WHEN I* use next-gen JavaScript in my application,
- *THEN I* find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors.

- *WHEN I* open the text editor,
- *THEN I* find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage.

- *WHEN I* enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window,
- *THEN I* find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB.

- *WHEN I* reopen the text editor after closing it,
- *THEN I* find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB.

- *WHEN I* click on the Install button,
- *THEN I* download my web application as an icon on my desktop.

- *WHEN I* load my web application,
- *THEN I* should have a registered service worker using workbox.

- *WHEN I* register a service worker,
- *THEN I* should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets.

- *WHEN I* deploy to render
- *THEN I* should have proper build scripts for a webpack application

# Algorithm:

1. Setup Project Structure:
  - Create separate folders for client and server.
  - Initialize npm and install necessary packages.
  - Configure webpack for JavaScript bundling.

2. Develop Backend:
  - Set up a basic server using Node.js.
  - Implement routes for serving the client and handling data storage and retrieval.

3. Develop Frontend:
  - Create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
  - Implement UI for text editing, saving, and retrieving data.
  - Integrate IndexedDB for local data storage.

4. Webpack Configuration:
  - Configure webpack for bundling JavaScript files.
  - Set up plugins for HTML file generation, service worker, and manifest file.

5. Service Worker Implementation:
  - Implement a service worker using workbox.
  - Configure pre-caching of static assets and pages.

6. Testing and Debugging:
  - Test the application in various browsers.
  - Ensure compatibility with next-gen JavaScript.
  - Debug any issues that arise.

7. Deployment Preparation:
  - Create build scripts suitable for render deployment.
  - Test the build process and fix any deployment-related issues.

8. Deployment to render:
  - Deploy the application to render.
  - Perform post-deployment testing to ensure functionality.

## Tasks:

1. Set up the project directory with client and server folders.
2. Initialize the backend server with Node.js.
3. Develop the frontend interface for the text editor.
4. Integrate IndexedDB for data storage.
5. Configure webpack and its plugins.
6. Implement and test the service worker.
7. Prepare and test build scripts for render.
8. Deploy the application to render.

---

## Pattern Recognition:

- The application follows a typical client-server model.
- Use of modern web technologies (IndexedDB, service workers).
- Integration of webpack for module bundling and asset management.
- Deployment pattern compatible with cloud platforms like render.
